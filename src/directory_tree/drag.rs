//! v0.4: drag-and-drop state machine.
//!
//! The widget tracks an in-flight drag through a small state
//! machine and emits a [`DragCompleted`](crate::DirectoryTreeEvent::DragCompleted)
//! event when the user releases over a valid drop target. The
//! widget itself never touches the filesystem — the application is
//! responsible for actually moving / copying / symlinking / etc. the
//! dragged paths. This keeps the widget a pure UI layer that works
//! equally well for local files, network shares, zip archives, or
//! any other hierarchical backend the app exposes.
//!
//! # Valid drop target
//!
//! A path `T` is a valid drop target for a drag carrying source set
//! `S = {s1, s2, ...}` iff:
//!
//! 1. `T` is a directory — you can't drop into a file.
//! 2. `T` is not itself a member of `S` — dropping A onto A is a no-op.
//! 3. `T` is not a descendant of any member of `S` — dropping
//!    `/foo` onto `/foo/bar` would create a circular move.
//!
//! Validity is recomputed on every [`DragMsg::Entered`] event; the
//! view reads `DragState::hover` to paint a highlight on the current
//! drop target.
//!
//! # Deferred selection
//!
//! Because drags start with a mouse-down on a row and the same
//! mouse-down would otherwise collapse a multi-selection to that
//! single row (via v0.3's `SelectionMode::Replace`), the widget
//! uses the standard "deferred selection" pattern: the view emits
//! [`DragMsg::Pressed`] on mouse-down — which does **not** change
//! the selection — and [`DragMsg::Released`] on mouse-up. If the
//! release is on the same row as the press (i.e., the gesture was
//! a click, not a drag), the widget dispatches a
//! [`Selected(_, _, SelectionMode::Replace)`](crate::DirectoryTreeEvent::Selected)
//! event at that point. This matches Windows Explorer / macOS
//! Finder / VS Code behaviour: clicking an already-selected item
//! doesn't clobber the multi-selection until the user lets go
//! without having moved.

//! # iced-swdir-tree
//!
//! A reusable [`iced`] widget for displaying a directory tree with lazy
//! loading, filtering, selection, and asynchronous traversal.
//!
//! Built on top of [`swdir`]'s `scan_dir` for single-level, non-recursive
//! directory listings — perfect for GUI trees that expand one folder at a
//! time.
//!
//! ## Minimal example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::path::PathBuf;
//! use iced::{Element, Task};
//! use iced_swdir_tree::{DirectoryFilter, DirectoryTree, DirectoryTreeEvent};
//!
//! #[derive(Debug, Clone)]
//! enum Message {
//!     Tree(DirectoryTreeEvent),
//! }
//!
//! struct App {
//!     tree: DirectoryTree,
//! }
//!
//! impl App {
//!     fn new() -> (Self, Task<Message>) {
//!         let tree = DirectoryTree::new(PathBuf::from("."))
//!             .with_filter(DirectoryFilter::FilesAndFolders);
//!         (Self { tree }, Task::none())
//!     }
//!
//!     fn update(&mut self, message: Message) -> Task<Message> {
//!         match message {
//!             Message::Tree(event) => {
//!                 // Observe app-level side effects BEFORE passing to the widget.
//!                 if let DirectoryTreeEvent::Selected(path, is_dir) = &event {
//!                     println!("selected {:?} (dir={})", path, is_dir);
//!                 }
//!                 self.tree.update(event).map(Message::Tree)
//!             }
//!         }
//!     }
//!
//!     fn view(&self) -> Element<'_, Message> {
//!         self.tree.view(Message::Tree)
//!     }
//! }
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
//!
//! ## Feature flags
//!
//! * **`icons`** (off by default) — when enabled, uses [`lucide-icons`] for
//!   folder/file graphics. When disabled, icons fall back to short text
//!   labels (`▸ `, `▾ `, etc.). The public API is identical either way.
